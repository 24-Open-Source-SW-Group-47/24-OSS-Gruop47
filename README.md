# Open Source SW - Term Project Group 47
This folder contains the term project repository for Open Source SW Group 47. 

Our team consists of three members who have each independently developed an open-source software project.

## Project Overview
In this project, each member has developed an independent open-source software and uploaded it under separate folders. Key points of the project are as follows:
- Each member has created and shared their own open-source project independently.
- External libraries and packages such as Huggingface (Transformers) and OpenCV were utilized, among others.
- Each project includes a separate 'README.md' file for individual project descriptions.

## Members and Project List
Group 47 followed the approach of having each member independently develop their own open-source software and upload it in separate folders as part of the term project.
