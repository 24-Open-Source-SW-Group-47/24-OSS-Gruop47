# Open Source SW - Term Project Group 47
This folder contains the term project repository for Open Source SW Group 47. 

Our team consists of three members who have each independently developed an open-source software project.

## Project Overview
In this project, each member has developed an independent open-source software and uploaded it under separate folders. Key points of the project are as follows:
- Each member has created and shared their own open-source project independently.
- External libraries and packages such as Huggingface (Transformers) and OpenCV were utilized, among others.
- Each project includes a separate 'README.md' file for individual project descriptions.

## Members and Project List
Group 47 followed the approach of having each member independently develop their own open-source software and upload it in separate folders as part of the term project.

| Member  | Student ID | Project Name   | Description           | Link                                      |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 박재민   | 201835457 | **Document Risk Analyzer**  | A Python-based tool to analyze documents for potential risks, supporting PDF, DOCX, and TXT formats. The tool extracts text, classifies risk-related sentences using HuggingFace models, and visualizes results in a structured table format. | [README](./201835457%20박재민)     |
| 이민지   | 202235083 | **Sentiment_analysis**  | This project uses Hugging Face's transformers library to perform emotion analysis on text data. The results of the analysis are visualized using matplotlib to provide an intuitive understanding of the detected emotions.  | [README](./202235083%20이민지)     |
| 유정규   | 202434641 | **Vision-Based Object Mosaic**  | A Python-based tool that detects and applies mosaic effects to specific objects in images using computer vision techniques. The tool supports customizable mosaic strength, processes images via pre-trained YOLO models, and allows users to obscure desired objects by targeting them directly.     | [README](./202434641%20유정규)     |


## Contribution Guidelines
1. Add code to your respective project folder.
2. Write and upload a 'README.md' file within your project folder for project description.
